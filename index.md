# Talks
### Summability, Spectral Concentration, Resonance and Fermi Golden Rule: November 27th, 2022
This is a talk at the seminar of 'Nonlinear Analysis, Variational Methods and Spectral Theory'.

Under strong asymptoticity, the Rayleigh-Schrodinger series can uniquely determine the perturbed eigenvalue, using Borel summability method. When an eigenvalue 'dissolve' into the continuous spectrum as soon as perturbation starts, we can use the theory of spectral concentration (strong convergence of spectral projection) to describe what happens: as perturbation becomes zero, the continuous spectrum will be concentrated back into an isolated eigenvalue (the reverse process of 'dissolve'). In 'Resonance and Fermi Golden Rule' we talked about how to describe the perturbation of an eigenvalue attached to the end of a continuous spectrum; Dilations are introduced as the analytic continuation of an one-parameter unitary group, preserving the value of eigenvalues; 'Resonance Pole' refers to those eigenvalue under the real axis, making a bump for relevant quantities such as scattering amplitude; Fermi golden rule is used to calculate the perturbation of these eigenvalues, where it's possible that we can use this to prove the asymptotic stability of a system.

### Regular and Asymptotic Perturbation Theory for Discrete Spectrum: November 20th, 2022
This is a talk at the seminar of 'Nonlinear Analysis, Variational Methods and Spectral Theory'.

I first briefly talked about how to understand using Hamiltonian operator as the generator in Schrodinger equation, using classical limit and path integrals. Then I talked about different definitions of 'Analytic family of operator', in the sense of Kato or 'Type A', and how can we use Riesz projector to bring this analyticity to the perturbation of discrete spectrum. When the spectrum is analytically perturbated, we can write this perturbation as the so-called Rayleigh-Schr$\Ddot{o}$dinger series. Then I talked about when this series diverge, how can we prove the perturbation of point spectrum is asymptotic to Rayleigh-Schrodinger series.

### Leray-Schauder Degree and Global Bifurcation: August 11th, 2022
This is a series of talks at the seminar of 'Nonlinear Analysis, Variational Methods and Spectral Theory'.

We can define Leray-Schauder degree for operators as a identity operator with a compact perturbation. This degree reveals topological invariants in different operators. For local bifurcation, we handle the problem by spectral analysis and Lyapunov-Schimdt reduction, where existence of certain solutions plays a central role . Meanwhile, Leray-Schauder degree describe the existence of solutions in an entire region. This enables us to give a global description of bifurcation lines. Key theorems include Leray-Schauder theorem and Rabinowitz's theorem. A classical application is Euler's elastic rod.

### Brouwer Degree: Definition and Applications: August 4th, 2022
This is a series of talks at the seminar of 'Nonlinear Analysis, Variational Methods and Spectral Theory'.

Aside from basic properties, I talked about the equivalence of definitions using C^1-approximation or de Rham cohomology.

### Order Method and Convexity Method in Fixed Points Theory: July 20th, 2022
This is a talk at the seminar of 'Nonlinear Analysis, Variational Methods and Spectral Theory'.

For order method, many theorems emerged based on Bourbaki-Kneser principle. Among applications there is uniformization theorem for Riemannian manifold with negative curvature. For convexity method, many theorems emerged based on Ky-Fan's inequality. Among applications there are Nash's equilibrium, Von Neumann-Sion's theorem about saddle points and infinite dimensional convex optimization.

### On Prof. Perthame and Prof. Skrzeczkowski's Fast Reaction Limit with Nonmonotone Reaction Function: May 19th, 2022
This is a talk at Prof. Zhennan Zhou's seminar, about this paper from CPAM 2022

Oscillation is an interesting and universal phenomenon in mathematical biology. In this paper, the authors used the theory of Young measure and the spirit of kinetic formulation, to show the existence of extreme oscillation in non-monotone reaction-diffusion system. I also discussed about the possibility of generalizing this method to other fields, such as mathematical neuroscience.

### Besov Space Estimates in Transport and Transport&Diffusion Equationss: May 10th, 2022

This is a talk at the seminar of 'Harmonic Analysis and Related PDEs'.

For diffusive transport equations, we can use regularizations to get approximate solutions, while using compactness to find their weak limit, which is a weak solution of the original equation.

### Solvability of Constant Coefficients PDE and Hypoellipticity: April 12th, 2022

This is a talk at the seminar of 'Harmonic Analysis and Related PDEs'.
 
Analogous to using Fourier transform to solve heat equation, we can also generalize this method to general PDEs with constant coefficients, where we can use Cauchy's theorem to transform different integrations in C. I also briefly talked about the concept of Hypo-ellipticity.

### Geometry of Uniform Spanning Forest: November 2021
This is a talk at '3+X' probability seminar held at Peking University.

I talked about the paper 'Geometry of the Uniform Spanning Forest: Transitions in Dimensional 4,8,12...' from 'Annals of Mathematics', 2004. This paper used the concept of stochastic dimension to prove a relation for the correlation between the dimension of ground space Z^d and the maximal interval length between different components of USF. 

# Short notes on neuroscience
### Temporal whitening by power-law adaptation in neocortical neurons
Neural signaling requires a large amount of metabolic energy, so to minimize energy consumption, the neural codes are dynamically modified so as to maximize information transmission, which means a low signal-to-noise ratio. Spike-frequency adaptation's power-law decay at different time scales decorrelates signals temporally distant and correlating temporally close signals. 

A question naturally emerge: how can we describe this adaptation-decay mathematically? There has been some specific hazard functions proposed in mathematical community, such as homogenous step function, and by some probabilistic analysis we can see that homogenous step function may cause heterogeneous temporal correlation. Given a hazard function, can we theoretically analysis its temporal correlation scale? Given a energy-consumption function, can we give an optimal current pattern minimizing energy-consumption?

### Mind the last spike — firing rate models for mesoscopic populations of spiking neurons
Mathematically speaking, synchronization refers to any stability around characteristic solutions: steady states or temporally periodic solutions.

Although there may be the chance that discharging only depends on the last spike, but previous spikes's effect may accumulate to a significant scale, indicating population temporal average as a useful statistic.

### Relations between the statistics of natural images and the response properties of cortical cells
A central problem in neural transmission is that how does the network reduce redundancy? Like Barlow suggests that the purpose of natural image processing is "to represent visual scenes by activity of a sparse selection of reliable and nonredundant (i.e., independent) elements.". This paper talks about how neurons perform temporal/spatial local fourier transform/frequency-selection/Gabor filtering and reduce the order of redundancy in early visual processing.

Notice that n-order redundancy refers to the non-uniformness of the conditional probability given a pair of (n-1)-elements. An interesting example is that, consider a 2-D graph with lines of different orientations from an unknown point, there is a significant second-order redundancy: given two pixels' intensity, we can determine the line's intensity through the two points (second-order conditional probability). The task will be use certain decorrelation to reduce this redundancy and reduce 2-D to 1-D.

Here is how Gabor filtering (locally concentrating, spatial or spatial-temporal, fourier transform) works and reduce redundancy. This is also a strong evidence for decorrelation of neural signals.

### Decorrelation and efficient coding by retinal ganglion cells
Many biologists proposed that neural network uses filtering to reduce redundancy and maximize information transmission. This paper especially discussed spatio-temporal decorrelation, and proposed that the main mechanism to decorrelate is the nonlinearity: antagonistic center and surround regions. By statistical analysis, the authors showed that after convolution of spatio-temporal receptive field and natural stimulus, the correlation are reduced below the correlation in natural stimulus.
